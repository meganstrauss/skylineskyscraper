Skyline Sidescroller---a sidescroller game in which the user inputs an image of a skyline or chooses from a library of preloaded images, then moves a character across the buildings, avoiding enemies and projectiles and collecting coins. When the game starts, the sky of the image is replaced by a sky generated by random pixels and blurred. If the player reaches a point in which a building is too tall for them to jump over, the building shrinks, making it more accessible to them. Each time the game is started, a difficulty is calculated for the level based off of how tall the buildings are in the image, and in the end, a star rating is given to them if they are able to make it across the skyline.


The game can be run in an editor and the game starts by running the tp.py file. 
To use the upload feature, any image url (ie skyline.jpg is saved in the folder) saved to the same folder can be inputted into the prompt and a skyline will be generated from that.


I use OpenCV, numpy, and PIL libraries.
